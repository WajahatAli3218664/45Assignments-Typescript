// More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more 
// comparisons, write more tests. Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:
// • Tests for equality and inequality with strings

console.log("Equality Test with strings:", "Strawberry" === "Strawberry" );
console.log("Iniquality Test with Strings:", ("Strawberry" as string) != "Apple");

// • Tests using the lower case function

console.log("Lowercase function:", "WAJAHAT".toLowerCase() === "wajahat");
console.log("Lowercase function:", "wajahat".toUpperCase() === "WAJAHAT");

// • Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, 

console.log("Equal to:", 10 === 10);
console.log("Not equal to:", (10 as number) != 5);


// greater than and less than,


console.log("Greater than", "b" > "a");
console.log("Less than", "a" < "b");

// greater than or equal to,

console.log("Greater than or equal to:", 30 >= 29 )
console.log("Less than or equal to:", 49 <= 50);

// • Tests using "and" and "or" operators

console.log("Tests using and operator:", "a" === "a" && 100 >= 100);
console.log("Test using or operator:", "car" === "car" || ("mobile" as string) === "laptop" );

// • Test whether an item is in a array

let fruits: string[] = ["Mango", "Banana", "Guava", "Strawberry"]  
console.log(`Test "Mango" is in an array:`, fruits.includes("Mango"));

// • Test whether an item is not in a array

console.log(`Test "Orange" is not in an array:`, !fruits.includes("Orange"));
